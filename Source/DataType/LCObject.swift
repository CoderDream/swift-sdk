     Save object and its all descendant objects synchronously.

     The detail save process is described as follows:

     1. Save deepest newborn orphan objects in one batch request.
     2. Repeat step 1 until all descendant newborn objects saved.
     3. Save root object and all descendant dirty objects in one batch request.

     Definition:

     - Newborn object: object which has no object id.
     - Orphan  object: object which exists in array or dictionary of another object.
     - Dirty   object: object which has object id and was changed (has operations).

     The reason to apply above steps is that:

     We can construct a batch request when newborn object directly attachs on another object.
     However, we cannot construct a batch request for orphan object.
