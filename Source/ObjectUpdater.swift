     The detail save process is described as follows:

     Definition:

     - Newborn orphan object: object which has no object id and its parent is not an object.
     - Dirty object: object which has object id and was changed (has operations).

     The reason to apply above steps is that:

     We can construct a batch request when newborn object directly attachs on another object.
     However, we cannot construct a batch request for orphan object.
